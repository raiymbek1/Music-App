Apologize

I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down
But wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around and say

That it's too late to apologize,
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize,
It's too late

I'd take another chance,
Take a fall, take a shot for you
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
But that's nothing new)

I loved you with a fire red,
Now it's turning blue
And you say
Sorry like an angel,
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

That it's too late to apologize,
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize,
It's too late

That it's too late to apologize,
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize,
It's too late

I said it's too late to apologize, yeah yeah
I said it's too late to apologize, a yeah

I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the groundâ€¦
